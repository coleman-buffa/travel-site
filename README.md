# Travel Site Mock Up

This repo is practice building a front end for a travel services company. There is no back end functionality intended for this project. I used [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s) for inspiration, design specs, and getting help when stuck. Thank you BrianDesign!

## Lessons Learned
